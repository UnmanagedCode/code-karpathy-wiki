## Documentation guidelines
Layer docs; on any behavior change, update the most specific file — not just the README.
- `docs/features.md` — user-facing features, UI, new tools.
- `docs/protocol.md` — interface contracts: endpoints, message types, protocol flags, wire formats.
- `docs/architecture.md` — internals: components, lifecycle, on-disk state, migrations, test patterns.
- `README.md` — overview, quick start, key defaults, known limitations; add a one-line note here only when a change adds a new top-level subsystem.
This overrides the workspace README-maintenance update rule here: README changes only for new top-level subsystems; new commands/flags/endpoints go to the matching `docs/*.md`.
The workspace "Be precise and compact" rule applies to all doc files, not just the README.
